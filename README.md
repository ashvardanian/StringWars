# StringWars

## Text Processing on CPUs & GPUs, in Python 🐍 & Rust 🦀

![StringWars Thumbnail](https://github.com/ashvardanian/ashvardanian/blob/master/repositories/StringWa.rs.jpg?raw=true)

There are many __great__ libraries for string processing!
Mostly, of course, written in Assembly, C, and C++, but some in Rust as well. 😅

Where Rust decimates C and C++, is the __simplicity__ of dependency management, making it great for benchmarking "Systems Software" and lining up apples-to-apples across native crates and their Python bindings.
So, to accelerate the development of the [`StringZilla`](https://github.com/ashvardanian/StringZilla) C, C++, and CUDA libraries (with Rust and Python bindings), I've created this repository to compare it against some of my & communities most beloved Rust projects, like:

- [`memchr`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/memchr) for substring search.
- [`rapidfuzz`](https://github.com/rapidfuzz/rapidfuzz-rs) for edit distances.
- [`aHash`](https://github.com/tkaitchuck/aHash) and [`crc32fast`](https://github.com/srijs/rust-crc32fast) for hashing.
- [`aho_corasick`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/aho-corasick) and [`regex`](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex) for multi-search.
- [`arrow`](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs) and [`polars`](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars) for collections.

Of course, the functionality of the projects is different, as are the APIs and the usage patterns.
So, I focus on the workloads for which StringZilla was designed and compare the throughput of the core operations.
Notably, I also favor modern hardware with support for a wider range SIMD instructions, like mask-equipped AVX-512 on x86 starting from the 2015 Intel Skylake-X CPUs or more recent predicated variable-length SVE and SVE2 on Arm, that aren't often supported by existing libraries and tooling.

## Hash

Many great hashing libraries exist in Rust, C, and C++.
Typical top choices are `aHash`, `xxHash`, `blake3`, `gxhash`, `CityHash`, `MurmurHash`, `crc32fast`, or the native `std::hash`.
Many of them have similar pitfalls:

- They are not always documented to have a certain reproducible output and are recommended for use only for local in-memory construction of hash tables, not for serialization or network communication.
- They don't always support streaming and require the whole input to be available in memory at once.
- They don't always pass the SMHasher test suite, especially with `--extra` checks enabled.
- They generally don't have a dynamic dispatch mechanism to simplify shipping of precompiled software.
- They are rarely available for multiple programming languages.

StringZilla addresses those issues and seems to provide competitive performance.
On Intel Sapphire Rapids CPU, on `xlsum.csv` dataset, the following numbers can be expected for hashing individual whitespace-delimited words and newline-delimited lines:

> ¹ Portability means availability in multiple other programming languages, like C, C++, Python, Java, Go, JavaScript, etc.
> ² Most hash functions work on both x86 and Arm, as well as many other CPU architectures, but gxHash, and many MurMurHash and CityHash implementations don't.

In larger systems, however, we often need the ability to incrementally hash the data.
This is especially important in distributed systems, where the data is too large to fit into memory at once.

## Substring Search

Substring search is one of the most common operations in text processing, and one of the slowest.
Most of the time, programmers don't think about replacing the `str::find` method, as it's already expected to be optimized.
In many languages it's offloaded to the C standard library [`memmem`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/memmem.3.html) or [`strstr`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/byte/strstr) for `NULL`-terminated strings.
The C standard library is, however, also implemented by humans, and a better solution can be created.

| `stringzilla.find`  |    __10.82 GiB/s__ |   __11.79 GiB/s__ |

Interestingly, the reverse order search is almost never implemented in SIMD, assuming fewer people ever need it.
Still, those are provided by StringZilla mostly for parsing tasks and feature parity.

## Byte-Set Search

StringWars takes a few representative examples of various character sets that appear in real parsing or string validation tasks:

- tabulation characters, like `\n\r\v\f`;
- HTML and XML markup characters, like `</>&'\"=[]`;
- numeric characters, like `0123456789`.

It's common in such cases, to pre-construct some library-specific filter-object or Finite State Machine (FSM) to search for a set of characters.
Once that object is constructed, all of it's inclusions in each token (word or line) are counted.
Current numbers should look like this:

## Sequence Operations

Rust has several Dataframe libraries, DBMS and Search engines that heavily rely on string sorting and intersections.
Those operations mostly are implemented using conventional algorithms:

- Comparison-based Quicksort or Mergesort for sorting.
- Hash-based or Tree-based algorithms for intersections.

Assuming the compares can be accelerated with SIMD and so can be the hash functions, StringZilla could already provide a performance boost in such applications, but starting with v4 it also provides specialized algorithms for sorting and intersections.
Those are directly compatible with arbitrary string-comparable collection types with a support of an indexed access to the elements.

## Random Generation & Lookup Tables

Some of the most common operations in data processing are random generation and lookup tables.
That's true not only for strings but for any data type, and StringZilla has been extensively used in Image Processing and Bioinformatics for those purposes.

## Similarities Scoring

Edit Distance calculation is a common component of Search Engines, Data Cleaning, and Natural Language Processing, as well as in Bioinformatics.
It's a computationally expensive operation, generally implemented using dynamic programming, with a quadratic time complexity upper bound.
For biological sequences, the Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman algorithms are more appropriate, as they allow overriding the default substitution costs.
Each of those has two flavors - with linear and affine gap penalties, also known as the "Gotoh" variation.

## Byte-level Fingerprinting & Sketching Benchmarks

In large-scale Retrieval workloads a common technique is to convert variable-length messy strings into some fixed-length representations.
Those are often called "fingerprints" or "sketches", like "Min-Hashing" or "Count-Min-Sketching".
There are a million variations of those algorithms, all resulting in different speed-vs-accuracy tradeoffs.
Two of the approximations worth considering is the number of collisions of produced individual hashes withing fingerprints, and the bit-distribution entropy of the produced fingerprints.
Adjusting all implementation to the same tokenization scheme, one my experience following numbers:

The trickiest part, however, is analyzing the retrieval quality of those fingerprints and comparing them to other approaches.
So, how many bits per fingerprint are needed to achieve a specific recall rate for a given dataset?
Or, how does the average Levenshtein distance among the top-k nearest neighbors change with the fingerprint size?
It must clearly decrease, but how fast, and how does that compare to ground truth?
For that please, check out the [HashEvals](https://github.com/ashvardanian/HashEvals) repository.

## Replicating the Results

### Replicating the Results in Rust 🦀

Before running benchmarks, you can test your Rust environment running:

```bash
cargo install cargo-criterion --locked
```

To pull and compile all the dependencies, you can call:

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo build --benches --all-features                  # to compile everything
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo check --benches --all-features --all-targets    # to fail on warnings
```

By default StringWars links `stringzilla` in CPU mode.
If the machine has an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA installed, enable the CUDA kernels explicitly when running benches, for example:

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" \
    STRINGWARS_DATASET=README.md \
    STRINGWARS_TOKENS=lines \
    STRINGWARS_FILTER=GPU \
    cargo criterion --features "cuda bench_similarities" bench_similarities --jobs 1
```

Wars always take long, and so do these benchmarks.
Every one of them includes a few seconds of a warm-up phase to ensure that the CPU caches are filled and the results are not affected by cold start or SIMD-related frequency scaling.
Each of them accepts a few environment variables to control the dataset, the tokenization, and the error bounds.
You can log those by printing file-level documentation using `awk` on Linux:

```bash
awk '/^\/\/!/ { print } !/^\/\/!/ { exit }' bench_find.rs
```

Commonly used environment variables are:

- `STRINGWARS_DATASET` - the path to the textual dataset file.
- `STRINGWARS_TOKENS` - the tokenization mode: `file`, `lines`, or `words`.
- `STRINGWARS_ERROR_BOUND` - the maximum allowed error in the Levenshtein distance.

Here is an example of a common benchmark run on a Unix-like system:

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" \
    STRINGWARS_DATASET=README.md \
    STRINGWARS_TOKENS=lines \
    cargo criterion --features bench_hash bench_hash --jobs $(nproc)
```

On Windows using PowerShell you'd need to set the environment variable differently:

```powershell
$env:STRINGWARS_DATASET="README.md"
cargo criterion --jobs $(nproc)
```

### Replicating the Results in Python 🐍

It's recommended to use `uv` for Python dependency management and running the benchmarks.
To install all dependencies for all benchmarks:

```sh
uv venv --python 3.12
uv pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-cuda.txt
uv pip install --only-binary=:all: -r requirements.txt -r requirements-cuda.txt
```

To install dependencies for individual benchmarks:

```sh
PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL=https://pypi.nvidia.com \
uv pip install '.[find,hash,sequence,fingerprints,similarities]'
```

To run individual benchmarks, you can call:

```sh
uv run --no-project python bench_hash.py --help
uv run --no-project python bench_find.py --help
uv run --no-project python bench_memory.py --help
uv run --no-project python bench_sequence.py --help
uv run --no-project python bench_similarities.py --help
uv run --no-project python bench_fingerprints.py --help 🔜
```

## Datasets

### ASCII Corpus

For benchmarks on ASCII data I've used the English Leipzig Corpora Collection.
It's 124 MB in size, 1'000'000 lines long, and contains 8'388'608 tokens of mean length 5.

```bash
curl -fL -o leipzig1M.txt https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/42sort/leipzig1m.txt
STRINGWARS_DATASET=leipzig1M.txt cargo criterion --jobs $(nproc)
```

### UTF8 Corpus

For richer mixed UTF data, I've used the XL Sum dataset for multilingual extractive summarization.
It's 4.7 GB in size (1.7 GB compressed), 1'004'598 lines long, and contains 268'435'456 tokens of mean length 8.
To download, unpack, and run the benchmarks, execute the following bash script in your terminal:

```bash
curl -fL -o xlsum.csv.gz https://github.com/ashvardanian/xl-sum/releases/download/v1.0.0/xlsum.csv.gz
gzip -d xlsum.csv.gz
STRINGWARS_DATASET=xlsum.csv cargo criterion --jobs $(nproc)
```

### DNA Corpus

For bioinformatics workloads, I use the following datasets with increasing string lengths:

```bash
curl -fL -o acgt_100.txt 'https://huggingface.co/datasets/ashvardanian/StringWars/resolve/main/acgt_100.txt?download=true'
curl -fL -o acgt_1k.txt 'https://huggingface.co/datasets/ashvardanian/StringWars/resolve/main/acgt_1k.txt?download=true'
curl -fL -o acgt_10k.txt 'https://huggingface.co/datasets/ashvardanian/StringWars/resolve/main/acgt_10k.txt?download=true'
curl -fL -o acgt_100k.txt 'https://huggingface.co/datasets/ashvardanian/StringWars/resolve/main/acgt_100k.txt?download=true'
curl -fL -o acgt_1m.txt 'https://huggingface.co/datasets/ashvardanian/StringWars/resolve/main/acgt_1m.txt?download=true'
curl -fL -o acgt_10m.txt 'https://huggingface.co/datasets/ashvardanian/StringWars/resolve/main/acgt_10m.txt?download=true'
```

## Deep Profiling

In case you are profiling the some of the internal kernels of mentioned libraries, here are a few example commands to get around.
Such as using `ncu` for NVIDIA GPUs to evaluate the register usage and occupancy of the CUDA kernels used in StringZilla's Levenshtein distance calculation:

```bash
/usr/local/cuda/bin/ncu \
  --metrics launch__registers_per_thread,launch__occupancy_per_block_size,sm__warps_active.avg.pct_of_peak_sustained_active,sm__throughput.avg.pct_of_peak_sustained_elapsed,dram__throughput.avg.pct_of_peak_sustained_elapsed,dram__bytes.sum \
  --target-processes all \
  --kernel-name "levenshtein_on_each_cuda_thread" \
  --launch-skip 5 \
  --launch-count 1 \
  bash -c 'STRINGWARS_DATASET=acgt_100.txt STRINGWARS_BATCH=65536 STRINGWARS_TOKENS=lines STRINGWARS_FILTER="uniform/stringzillas::LevenshteinDistances\(1xGPU\)" cargo criterion --features "cuda bench_similarities" bench_similarities --jobs 1'
```

Using `perf` on Linux to analyze the CPU-side performance of SIMD-accelerated substring search:

```bash
perf record -e cpu-clock -g graph,0x400000 -o perf.data -- cargo criterion --features "bench_similarities" bench_similarities --jobs 1
perf report -i perf.data
```
